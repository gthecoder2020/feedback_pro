I want to build a SaaS platform called "All-in-One Business Feedback System".

This platform will allow any business type (restaurants, retail stores, hotels, healthcare, service centers, salons, etc.) to collect, manage, and analyze customer feedback in a modern, customizable, and scalable way.

✅ Core Platform Features:
Business Registration & Login (supports multiple business branches/locations with latitude & longitude).

Businesses can create unlimited QR codes for different service areas (example: reception, room cleaning, billing desk, food service).

Each QR code links to a customizable feedback form using a drag-and-drop form builder.

✅ Feedback Form Customization:
Businesses can build their forms with these field types:

Short Text Input

Long Text Input

Star Rating (1-5)

Scale Rating (1-10)

Image Upload

Video Upload

✅ Feedback Collection Flow:
Customers scan QR code → feedback form opens (web-based, no app required).

Customers can choose to submit feedback anonymously or with contact details.

Businesses receive feedback in real time.

✅ Business Dashboard Features:
View & manage feedback submissions

Analytics dashboard showing:

Average star/scale ratings

AI-powered sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral trend)

Media gallery of customer photos/videos

Alerts for negative feedback (auto-response option available)

Businesses can reply to customer feedback

✅ Admin (Super Admin) Features:
Manage business accounts and users

Setup subscription plans:

Free

Standard

Premium
(Each plan has feature limits like no. of QR codes, media uploads, analytics access)

Platform-wide analytics dashboard (feedback trends across all businesses)

Manage referral program and reward coins system.

✅ Bonus Features:
Coin-based reward system for customers (earn coins for feedback submission)

Referral system for businesses (invite other businesses and earn credits)

Push notifications using FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)

Multi-language support (English, Malayalam, Hindi to start)

✅ Technology Stack (Preferred):
Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + React.js, drag-and-drop via dnd-kit

Backend: Node.js (Express) + Prisma ORM

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: OTP-based (via Msg91 or similar service)

QR Codes: Generated via qrcode npm library (or Google Charts API)

AI Sentiment Analysis: Using HuggingFace transformers (or TensorFlow NLP)

Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

✅ Platform Goal:
Launch this as a scalable SaaS solution for businesses in India (starting with Kerala), with architecture ready to expand globally.
Design should be clean, minimal, mobile-responsive, with smooth drag-and-drop interactions and modern dashboard UI.

✅ Request:
Please suggest the best development roadmap and modular system architecture that ensures scalability, clean code structure (preferably monorepo), and best performance for a SaaS platform like this.
